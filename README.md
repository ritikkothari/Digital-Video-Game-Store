Welcome to the Game Distribution Website repository!

This project is a game distribution platform that empowers game developers to monetize and distribute their games effectively. With an elegant and user-friendly interface, we offer game titles as products, making it easy for gamers to discover and access exciting new games.

## Features

- **Elegant Interface:** Our website features an intuitive and visually appealing design, providing an enjoyable browsing and shopping experience for gamers.

- **Product Listings:** Games are showcased with detailed descriptions, screenshots, and other essential information to help users make informed decisions.
